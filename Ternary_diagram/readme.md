Ternary diagrams were generated to show the distribution of the bacterial species associated with
periodontal disease within each phylum across the three study groups at both visits.

The species Filifactor alocis, within the phylum Firmicutes, was oriented towards the CS and ES
groups at both visits. The Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies animalis was oriented towards
the ES group, while the vincentii subspecies were oriented towards the CS group. The species
Porphyromonas gingivalis and
Tannerella forsythia,
within the phylum Bacteroidetes, were
oriented towards the CS and ES group at the baseline visit, but shifted towards the ES group at
the follow-up visit. The species Prevotella intermedia was oriented towards the CS group at the
baseline visit and shifted towards the ES group at the follow-up visit. The species Treponema
denticola, within the phylum Spirochaetes, was centered at the baseline visit, but shifted toward
the ES group at the follow-up visit, indicating an increase in its relative abundance in e-cigarette-
smoking patients. The distribution of bacterial species assigned to other phyla also indicated
shifts over time, potentially due to participantsâ€™ smoking habits.
