**Alpha Diversity**

At the baseline visit, alpha diversity indices revealed that patients in the ES group had a significantly higher phylogenetic diversity (PD) than those in the NS group (Figure 1A). Patients in the SES group had a significantly higher number of observed ASVs, Shannon index, and PD than did the SNS patients who were at the same disease stage at enrollment (Figure 1B), indicating greater richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity of bacterial species in the e-cigarette smokers with severe periodontitis relative to non-smokers with severe periodontitis. Patients with mild or moderate periodontitis had similar alpha diversity at the baseline visit across all study groups (Figure 1C). 


At the follow-up visit 6 months later, alpha diversity became similar across all the 3 groups, regardless of disease severity (Figure 1D-F). E-cigarette smokers and cigarette smokers remained similar; however, the differences between e-cigarette smokers and non-smokers at the follow-up visit were not significant. 
To assess the overall change of alpha diversity within a group over time, we compared paired samples between the two visits (Figure 1G). The observed number of ASVs significantly increased from baseline to the follow-up visit in all three groups, suggesting an increased number of unique ASVs and community richness over time. Shannon diversity index and PD significantly increased in cigarette smokers and non-smokers. It is noteworthy that severe e-cigarette smoking patients remained the highest at both baseline and follow-up visits compared to other groups in all alpha diversity measures.
