*Cytokine level analysis

We measured the effects of e-cigarette use on the levels of salivary inflammatory cytokines in all
101 subjects at both study visits. Some cytokine levels were significantly elevated at the follow-
up visit compared to the baseline visit.

Salivary IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α
significantly increased in all the three groups at the follow-up visit. IL-2 and IL-6 significantly
increased in the ES and NS groups, while IL-4 significantly increased in the CS and ES groups.
The level of IFN-γ, an immunoregulatory cytokine that plays an important role in the activation
of inflammatory processes, significantly increased in the ES group but not in the other two
groups.
