# The use of electronic cigarette enriches periodontal pathogens 
The effect of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) smoking, especially its long-term impact on the user’s oral health, is poorly understood. Here, we conducted a longitudinal clinical study with 2 study visits, 6 months apart, to investigate the effect of e-cigarette use on the saliva bacterial community structure in 101 periodontitis patients. Our data demonstrated that e-cigarette use altered the oral microbiome in periodontitis patients, enriching for Filifactor, Treponema, and Fusobacterium taxa. For patients at the same periodontal disease stage, cigarette smokers and e-cigarette smokers shared more similarities in their oral bacterial composition. E-cigarette smoking may have a similar potential as cigarette smoking in altering the bacterial composition over time, leading to an increase in the relative abundance of periodontal disease-associated pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The correlation analysis showed that certain genera such as Dialister, Selenomonas, and Leptotrichia in the e-cigarette smoking group were positively correlated with the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α. E-cigarette use also elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, contributing to oral microbiome dysbiosis and advanced disease state.
